    <h3>Book Summary</h3>
    <p>Have you ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes of a Dive Shop or what it takes to become and work as a
         Scuba Diving Professional? This book is great for those who enjoy dive stories, jokes, and practical advice.
          Even if you have never dove before, you will find something in this audiobook that will spark your interest
           in diving. I share my many experiences from first trying Scuba to finding a dive job in a tropical paradise.
            I have learned so much since my first breath underwater and hope to share with you all of the tips that will 
            make you become the best diver you can be!</p>

    <p>WWMSID The second book will be availible in 2024. Stories that were not appropraite for the new divers to hear about were removed
        from the first book. This book will no hold any punches towords the diving industry. It will have more stories and lessons leanrt from them.
        I tell the story of what ended my diving career. My biggest thing for the first book is whats the ending. Well This book has an ending and
        I am thankful I was able to walk away from my injury.
